# JFrog Transfer Migration Helper Scripts Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains a comprehensive set of scripts and tools for facilitating JFrog Platform migrations. The scripts provide functionality for data transfer, configuration comparison, and migration management across different stages of the migration process.

## Script Categories

### Pre-Migration Tools
- `before-migration-helper-scripts/`: Scripts for migration preparation
  - Maven repository configuration management
  - Log monitoring
  - Parallel transfer setup
  - Screen command generation

### Migration Tools
- `transfer-artifacts/`: Scripts for artifact transfer
  - Multi-repository synchronization
  - Delta transfer management
  - Local repository handling
- `copy-huge-mono-repos/`: Tools for large repository handling
- `create-repos/`: Repository creation utilities
- `patch_props_for_artifacts_already_in_target/`: Property patching tools

### Post-Migration Tools
- `after_migration_helper_scripts/`: Post-migration utilities
- `check-access-sync/`: Access synchronization verification
- `compare_2_jpd_configs_for_drift/`: Configuration comparison tools
- `troubleshoot-transfer-files-logs/`: Log analysis utilities

### Utility Scripts
- `runcommand_in_parallel_as_bash_jobs/`: Parallel execution tools
- `Fetch_URIs_for_SHA1s_missing_in_Source_BinaryStore/`: Binary store utilities
- `experimental_wip_scripts/`: Experimental features

3. Configuration comparison
4. Post-migration verification
5. Troubleshooting support

### Transfer Capabilities
1. Multi-repository transfer
2. Delta transfer
3. Parallel processing
4. Large repository handling
5. Property management

### Verification Tools
1. Configuration drift detection
2. Access synchronization
3. Log analysis

## Usage Examples

### Pre-Migration Tasks
```bash
# Update Maven snapshot behavior
./before-migration-helper-scripts/update-maven-snapshotVersionBehavior_to_unique.sh

# Monitor log growth
./before-migration-helper-scripts/monitor_log_growth/monitor.sh
```

### Migration Execution
```bash
# Transfer artifacts
./transfer-artifacts/jfrog_multi_repo_artifacts_sync_via_transfer-files/transfer.sh

# Compare configurations
python compare_2_jpd_configs_for_drift/compare_2_jpd_configs_v2.py
```

### Post-Migration Verification
```bash
# Check access synchronization
./check-access-sync/check_access_sync.sh

# Troubleshoot transfer logs
./troubleshoot-transfer-files-logs/analyze_logs.sh
```

## Dependencies
- JFrog CLI
- Python 3.x
- Bash shell
- Required JFrog CLI plugins
- Screen (for some operations)

## Best Practices
1. Follow migration stages in order
2. Verify configurations before migration
3. Monitor system resources
4. Use appropriate parallel processing
5. Document all changes
6. Test in non-production environment
7. Backup data before migration
8. Monitor log growth

## Notes
- Scripts support various migration scenarios
- Parallel processing available for large transfers
- Configuration drift detection included
- Log analysis tools provided
- Consider system resources during parallel operations
- Monitor transfer progress
- Validate configurations after migration
- Follow migration guidelines
