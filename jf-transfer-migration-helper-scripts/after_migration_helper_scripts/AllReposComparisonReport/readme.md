# Generate  Comparison Report for Repositories in Source and Target Artifactory Instances

This Python script [compare_repo_list_details_in_source_vs_target_rt_after_migration.py](compare_repo_list_details_in_source_vs_target_rt_after_migration.py) is designed to compare repository details between source and target Artifactory Instances and generate a comprehensive comparison report. It also assists in generating transfer commands for migrating repositories from a source Artifactory to a target Artifactory.

If  any repos in the source Artifactory have files that have not been transferred to the corresponding  target 
Artifactory repos  the report also generates the necessary [repodiff.py](../repoDiff/repodiff.py) commands  that 
can be run to get the delta in the `â€œoutput/<source-repo>/cleanpaths.txt"` as explained in the [readme.md](../repoDiff/readme.md)

**cleanpaths.txt**: Contains the URIs of artifacts present in the source repository but missing in the target repository. It also provides statistics on the total size and file extensions.



## Prerequisites

Before using this script, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Copy the `compare_repo_list_details_in_source_vs_target_rt_after_migration.py` to a machine that has access to 
   both the source and target Artifactory Instances , say to `/home/sureshv/comparison_report` :

```
cd /home/sureshv/comparison_report
```

2. Calculate the storage for the source and target Artifactory Instances  
```
jf rt curl -X POST "/api/storageinfo/calculate" --server-id=source
jf rt curl -X POST "/api/storageinfo/calculate" --server-id=target  
``` 

**Output:**
```
{"info":"Calculating storage summary scheduled to run successfully"}
```

3. wait for 2 min for calculation to complete.

4. Generate the storage details for all repos for the source and target Artifactory Instances
```
jf rt curl -X GET "/api/storageinfo" --server-id=source > source_storageinfo.json
jf rt curl -X GET "/api/storageinfo" --server-id=target > target_storageinfo.json
```

5. Get the list of `local` repos you want to compare:
```
jf rt curl  -X GET "/api/repositories?type=local"  --server-id=source | jq -r '.[] | .key' >> all_local_repos_in_source.txt

sort -o all_local_repos_in_source.txt all_local_repos_in_source.txt
```
If you want to exclude some repos (listed in `exclude_these_cust-responsibility_repos.txt`)  from all_local_repos_in_source.txt you can do:
```
comm -23 <(sort all_local_repos_in_source.txt) <(sort exclude_these_cust-resposibility_repos.txt) > ps_currently_migrating_for_group2.txt
```

Note:  For a  list of Federated repos you want to compare use:
```
jf rt curl  -X GET "/api/repositories?type=federated"  --server-id=source-server | jq -r '.[] | .key' >> all_federated_repos_in_source.txt

sort -o all_federated_repos_in_source.txt all_federated_repos_in_source.txt
```

## Usage
Assume the list of repos we want to compare is  [group2_found_in_all_local_repos_in_ncr.txt](input/group2_found_in_all_local_repos_in_ncr.txt)

6. Generate the comparison report (comparison.txt) in the "output" folder using:
```
python AllReposComparisonReport/compare_repo_list_details_in_source_vs_target_rt_after_migration.py \
 --source source_storageinfo.json \
 --target target_storageinfo.json \
 --repos AllReposComparisonReport/input/group2_found_in_all_local_repos_in_ncr.txt \
 --out comparison.txt \
 --source_server_id source \
 --target_server_id target

```
This will generate the report in [comparison.txt](output/comparison.txt)

## Command-line arguments:
```

--source: Path to the source JSON file containing repository details.
--target: Path to the target JSON file containing repository details.
--repos: Path to the text file containing repoKeys that the customer wants to migrate.
--out: the output comparison file where the report will be generated in the "ouput" folder.
--source_server_id: Server ID of the source Artifactory.
--target_server_id: Server ID of the target Artifactory.
--total_repos_customer_will_migrate (optional): Specify the number of repositories that the customer is responsible for migrating.
--num_buckets_for_migrating_remaining_repos (optional): Specify the number of Client VMs  used to run "jf rt transfer-files" . So that
                                                  the comparison report can bucket the repos and genetrate the "jf rt transfer-files" command.
--repo_threshold_in_gb (optional): Threshold in gigabytes (GB) for source repositories to generate alternate migrate commands.
--print_alternative_transfer (optional): Include this flag to print alternative transfer methods for large source repositories.
```
**Note:** For "Docker" packageType repos in the "--repos" list  , the comparison excludes  the  "repository.catalog" and 
"*_uploads" in the (source/target)_files_count 
     and (source/target)_space_in_bytes calculation , as the files in "*_uploads" from source will not be replicated to the target artifactory instance.


7.  To download  the comparison.txt  via ssh you can run:

```
cd /Users/sureshv/Documents/From_Customer/<customerName>

scp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa sureshv@p-gp2-artifactoryha1-2.imovetv.com:/home/sureshv/comparison_report/output/comparison_report_jun17_2024.txt .
```

8. On the machine in step1:

   ```cd /home/sureshv/comparison_report```

   Then run all the python3 [repodiff.py](../repoDiff/repodiff.py)  commands from [comparison_report_jun17_2024.txt](output/comparison_report_jun17_2024.txt)

All the differences are saved in `/home/sureshv/comparison_report/output/<repoName>/cleanpaths.txt` for each of 
the repos

9. You can use the `rsync` command with filters to selectively download only the `cleanpaths.txt` files while 
   preserving the directory structure. Here's the command you can use:

```bash
rsync -avz -e "ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa" --include="*/" --include="cleanpaths.txt" --exclude="*" sureshv@p-gp2-artifactoryha1-2.imovetv.com:/home/sureshv/comparison_report/output/ ./output
```
**Explanation:**
- `-avz`: This tells `rsync` to use archive mode, be verbose, and compress the data during the transfer.
- `-e "ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa"`: Specifies the SSH key to use for authentication.
- `--include="*/"`: Includes all directories (necessary for preserving the directory structure).
- `--include="cleanpaths.txt"`: Includes the `cleanpaths.txt` files.
- `--exclude="*"`: Excludes all other files.
- `sureshv@p-gp2-artifactoryha1-2.imovetv.com:/home/sureshv/comparison_report/output/`: The source directory on the remote server.
- `./output`: The destination directory on your local machine.

10. For each file located at `output/<repoName>/cleanpaths.txt`, search for the string `"Total Unique URIs in source"`. Extract the lines containing this string along with the corresponding `output/<repoName>/cleanpaths.txt` filename, but exclude any lines that contain `"Total Unique URIs in source: 0"`.

```
grep -rH "Total Unique URIs in source" output/*/cleanpaths.txt | grep -v "Total Unique URIs in source: 0"
```

You will get the output like following which shows the list of files  in each repo that are in the `Source` 
Artifactory but not yet transferred to the `target` Artifactory

```
output/aa-debian-local/cleanpaths.txt:Total Unique URIs in source: 28
output/adapt-mvn-local/cleanpaths.txt:Total Unique URIs in source: 2
output/artifactory-build-info/cleanpaths.txt:Total Unique URIs in source: 6
output/b-aa-debian-local/cleanpaths.txt:Total Unique URIs in source: 18
output/dba-debian-local/cleanpaths.txt:Total Unique URIs in source: 6
output/debian-beta/cleanpaths.txt:Total Unique URIs in source: 27
output/debian-dev/cleanpaths.txt:Total Unique URIs in source: 27
output/debian-production/cleanpaths.txt:Total Unique URIs in source: 27
output/devops-debian-local/cleanpaths.txt:Total Unique URIs in source: 35
output/dvrcloud-fr/cleanpaths.txt:Total Unique URIs in source: 27
output/dvrcloudnew/cleanpaths.txt:Total Unique URIs in source: 6
output/encoder-local/cleanpaths.txt:Total Unique URIs in source: 27
output/poc-debian-gpg-key1/cleanpaths.txt:Total Unique URIs in source: 18
output/qa-debian-local/cleanpaths.txt:Total Unique URIs in source: 35
output/yum-shared/cleanpaths.txt:Total Unique URIs in source: 6
```

11. Next Transfer this delta , based on  file list  in the  cleanpaths.txt ( i.e the files  in source repo and has not 
    been  transferred to the target repo) using [transfer_cleanpaths_delta_from_repoDiff.py](../fix_the_repoDiff/transfer_cleanpaths_delta_from_repoDiff.py)

Please review the [readme.md](../fix_the_repoDiff/readme.md) of  this script on the usage. It reads the  cleanpaths.txt
and transfers only the missing files to the target repository in the SAAS instance.

I have a handy script [generate_transfer_cleanpaths_commands_for_repolist.py](../fix_the_repoDiff/generate_transfer_cleanpaths_commands_for_repolist.py)
that takes in the semicolon seperated list of repos to generate the required 
`transfer_cleanpaths_delta_from_repoDiff.py` commands that you can run.

```
python generate_transfer_cleanpaths_commands_for_repolist.py  "aa-debian-local;adapt-mvn-local;artifactory-build-info;b-aa-debian-local;dba-debian-local;debian-beta;debian-dev;debian-production;devops-debian-local;dvrcloud-fr;dvrcloudnew;encoder-local;poc-debian-gpg-key1;qa-debian-local;yum-shared" > /Users/sureshv/Documents/From_Customer/<customerName>/output/transfer_cleanpaths.txt

```
Now run the commands from [transfer_cleanpaths.txt](../fix_the_repoDiff/transfer_cleanpaths.txt) to transfer the 
delta files from source Artifactory to target Artifactory

12. Repeat Steps 1-11 until the SAAS cutover  to be sure that all the delta binaries in the `Source` Artifactory have 
    been  transferred to the `target` i.e the JFrog SAAS instance.
