After migration is complete for huge mono repos you can setup replication .

For example for the merlin and liquid repos:
Replication configuration:
```
a)
0 15 10 ? * *
https://example.jfrog.io/artifactory/liquid/
sureshv
_/*

b) 0 15 12 ? * *
https://example.jfrog.io/artifactory/merlin/
```

---
Then check the replication status in the source JPD . But this requires Mission Control:

https://artifactory.example.com/ui/admin/mission_control/replications/

If you get error like the following in the artifactorty-service.log , then you will need to restart the source JPD:
```

```
After fixing that you should see the replication working :

To sync the binaries that are missing on the target , take the 
filepaths_nometadatafiles.txt got from [repoDiff/repodiff.py](repoDiff/repodiff.py) and use this as   the input file for [transfer-files.sh](https://github.com/shivaraman83/security-entities-migration/blob/main/transfer-files.sh) script. So please copy the transfer-files.sh file to the respective folder

Run as 
```
./transfer-files.sh <JF CLI Source Server ID> <JF CLI Target Server ID> <REPO_NAME> yes | sh
```
There are ways to run it muti-threaded as mentioned in 
- https://git.jfrog.info/projects/PROFS/repos/ps_jfrog_scripts/browse/transfer-artifacts

- [runcommand_in_parallel_and_log_outcome.sh](../runcommand_in_parallel_as_bash_jobs/runcommand_in_parallel_and_log_outcome.sh)
