##JFrog Platform Data Comparison Script

### Overview
This script compares data between two JFrog Platform Deployments (JPDs). It collects various entities such as repositories, users, groups, permissions, and more from both JPDs, compares them, and generates a report highlighting differences. The results are displayed in a tabular format and saved to a specified output file.

### Features
- **Data Collection**: Collects data for repositories, users, groups, permissions, tokens, projects, builds, property sets, Xray entities, and repository layouts.
- **Comparison**: Compares collected data, identifies unique and common entities, and highlights differing properties between the two JPDs.
- **Output**: Provides a human-readable comparison table and writes the results to an output file.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `argparse`, `requests`, `json`, `tabulate`, `urllib.parse`

### Usage

```bash
python jpd_compare.py <jpd_url1> <jpd_token1> <jpd_url2> <jpd_token2> <output_file> <jpd_version1> <jpd_version2>
```

### Parameters
- `<jpd_url1>`: URL of the first JPD.
- `<jpd_token1>`: Authentication token for accessing the first JPD.
- `<jpd_url2>`: URL of the second JPD.
- `<jpd_token2>`: Authentication token for accessing the second JPD.
- `<output_file>`: Path to the file where the differences will be saved.
- `<jpd_version1>`: Version of the first JPD in `x.y.z` format.
- `<jpd_version2>`: Version of the second JPD in `x.y.z` format.

### Script Details

1. **Data Collection (`collect_data`)**:
   - Collects data from various endpoints in the JPDs based on the version provided.
   - Handles different endpoints for permissions depending on the JPD version.
   - Collects entity names and associated JSON data for each entity type.

2. **Handling Permissions Endpoint Dynamically**:
   - **Different Endpoints**:
     - For JPD versions below 7.72.0, the permissions are accessed via the Artifactory security API: `"/artifactory/api/v2/security/permissions"`.
     - For JPD versions 7.72.0 and above, the permissions are accessed via the Access API: `"/access/api/v2/permissions"`.
   - **Dynamic Endpoint Selection**:
     - The script includes logic to select the appropriate permissions API endpoint based on the JPD version.
     - It determines which endpoint to use by comparing the provided JPD version against the version threshold (7.72.0).

   **Code Example**:
   ```python
   # Determine permissions API endpoint based on JPD version
   if jpd_version >= (7, 72, 0):
       permissions_endpoint = "/access/api/v2/permissions"
   else:
       permissions_endpoint = "/artifactory/api/v2/security/permissions"
   ```

   **Usage in `collect_data`**:
   When the script calls `collect_data`, it uses the determined `permissions_endpoint` to fetch permissions data:
   ```python
   entity_types = [
       # Other entities
       ("Permissions", permissions_endpoint),  # Use the dynamically determined endpoint
       # More entities
   ]
   ```

3. **Comparison (`compare_data`)**:
   - Compares collected data between the two JPDs.
   - Identifies unique entities in each JPD.
   - Highlights properties that differ between common entities.

4. **Display and Output (`display_differences`)**:
   - Formats the differences into a table using `tabulate`.
   - Prints the table to the console.
   - Writes the formatted table to the specified output file.

### Example

To compare data between two JPDs:

```bash
python jpd_compare.py http://jpd1.example.com <token1> http://jpd2.example.com <token2> differences.txt 7.71.0 7.72.0
```

### Error Handling
- The script provides meaningful error messages if data collection fails or if JSON parsing encounters issues.
- HTTP response content is printed for debugging if an API request fails.

### Notes
- Ensure the tokens provided have the necessary permissions to access the respective JPD endpoints.
- This script assumes that the JPD URLs are accessible and the endpoints are correct as per the JPD version provided.
